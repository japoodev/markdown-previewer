# Markdown Previwer App - FreeCodeCamp Project

I have created this app as a part of the FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification. This app is built using ReactJS and uses the MarkedJS library to convert the markdown to HTML.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Live Demo
